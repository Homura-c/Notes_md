# Vector Usage

declaration : 

vector<int> x;

vector<string> str;

vector<vector<int>> v;

**We cannot have vectors containing references!**



initialization:

vector<T> v1;

vector<T> v2(v1)    //v2 has a copy of each element in v1

vector<T> v2 = v1   //same as above

vector <T> v3 (n,val)   //v3 has n elements with value val

vector <T> v4(n)   //v4 has n copies of a value-initialized object

vector<T> v5{a,b,c...}  // list initialization. 

**If you wanna list initialize a vector, the objects in the brace must match the element type of the vector elements. **

suggestion: don't initialize vectors to a fixed capacity. It is efficient to add new elements to the vector. 



vector operations: 

v.empty()  //returns TRUE if the vector is empty.

v.size() //Like the name says.

v.push_back(t) //Adds an element with value t to the end of v

v[n] //like an array

v1 = v2 

v1==v2
